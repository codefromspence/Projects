# Projects
Summary of the Project and Problem Solved:
The project is a simple console-based calculator in C++ that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) by entering two operands and an operator. It repeatedly prompts for expressions until the user chooses to exit.
What Was Done Particularly Well:
The program features effective user interaction by allowing multiple calculations in one session and includes error handling for division by zero, preventing crashes and informing users of errors.
Enhancements and Their Benefits:
Enhancements could include using a switch-case structure for efficiency, adding input validation for robustness, and modularizing the code into functions for maintainability. These improvements would make the code more efficient, secure, and easier to maintain.
Challenging Pieces of Code:
Handling division by zero and ensuring correct user input parsing were challenging. These were overcome by adding conditional checks and considering invalid inputs, enhancing the program’s robustness.
Transferable Skills:
Skills gained include understanding basic programming constructs, error handling, and designing user-friendly interfaces. These are applicable to various other programming tasks and projects.
Making the Program Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable:
The program’s maintainability and readability were improved through comments, consistent naming conventions, and the potential for modularization. These practices make it easier to update and expand the code in the future.
